0.3.0
	Added support for the VatRateWebService from europa.eu, instead of
	hard-coding VAT rates.  This fetches data from the TIC.

	favour of applications constructing their own vat.RateCache object
	and querying for rates from that.

	Added a text version of the regular expression on the MemberState
	objects.

	Escape single quotes for VIES.

	Updated MOSS template.
